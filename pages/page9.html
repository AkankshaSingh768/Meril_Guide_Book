    <h2 style="margin-top: 18vh;"><span>B</span>alloon Angioplasty</h2>
    <p>
      A procedure where a balloon is inflated inside a narrowed artery to
      restore blood flow.
    </p>

    <h2>Balloon Catheter</h2>
    <p>
      A catheter with an inflatable balloon used to widen narrowed arteries.
    </p>

    <h2>Balloon Catheter Shaft</h2>
    <p>
      The central part of a balloon catheter through which it is inserted into
      the vessel.
    </p>

    <h2>Balloon Compliance</h2>
    <p>
      The ability of a balloon to expand to a specified diameter under pressure.
    </p>

    <h2>Balloon Crossing Profile</h2>
   
  </div>

  <!-- Right Column -->
  <div style="width: 50%;position: relative;z-index: 1;">
    <p>
      The ability of a balloon to pass through narrow or obstructed vessels.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Balloon Deflation</h2>
    <p>Collapsing and removing the balloon catheter after treatment.</p>

    <h2>Balloon Diameter</h2>
    <p>The width of a balloon catheter when inflated.</p>

    <h2>Balloon Dilatation</h2>
    <p>
      The process of expanding a balloon inside a vessel to treat a blockage.
    </p>

    <h2>Balloon Inflation</h2>
    <p>Expanding a balloon catheter inside a blood vessel to open it.</p>

    <h2>Balloon Length</h2>
    <p>The length of the balloon catheter from tip to base.</p>

    <h2>Balloon Profile</h2>
    <p>Characteristics of a balloon catheter, including its size and shape.</p>

    <h2>Balloon Rupture</h2>
    <p>
      Failure of a balloon catheter due to excessive pressure, leading to its
      burst.
    </p>

    <h2>Balloon Trackability</h2>
    <p>
      The ease with which a balloon catheter can be navigated through blood
      vessels.

    <h2>Bare-Metal Stent (BMS)</h2>
    <p>A stent made of metal with no drug coating.</p>

    <h2>Bioresorbable Scaffold</h2>
    <p>
      A temporary vascular scaffold that gradually dissolves after supporting
      the artery.
    </p>

    <h2>Biodegradable Polymer</h2>
    <p>A polymer used in stents that breaks down naturally over time.</p>
