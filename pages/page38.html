    <p>Medical care provided after heart valve surgery to ensure recovery.</p>
    <h2>Postoperative Monitoring</h2>
    <p>
      The process of observing a patient after valve surgery for complications
      or improvements.
    </p>

    <h2>Preoperative Assessment</h2>
    <p>
      Evaluation of a patient before heart valve surgery to plan the procedure.
    </p>

    <h2>Preoperative Imaging</h2>
    <p>
      Imaging done before surgery to assess the heart and valves for surgical
      planning.
    </p>

    <h2>Prosthesis</h2>
    <p>
      An artificial device used to replace a missing or damaged body part, such
      as a heart valve.
    </p>

    <h2>Prosthetic Material</h2>
    <p>The synthetic materials used to create artificial heart valves.</p>

    <h2>Prosthetic Valve</h2>
    <p>An artificial valve implanted to replace a damaged heart valve.</p>

    <h2>Prosthetic Valve Failure</h2>
    <p>
      The malfunctioning of a heart valve prosthesis, necessitating reoperation
      or replacement.
    </p>

    <h2>Pulmonary Valve</h2>
    <p>The valve located between the right ventricle and pulmonary artery.</p>

    <h2 class="span1"><span>R</span>egurgitant Valve</h2>
    <p>A valve that leaks, allowing blood to f low backward.</p>

    <h2>Regurgitation Volume</h2>
    <p>The amount of blood that leaks backward through a faulty valve.</p>

    <h2 class="span1"><span>S</span>ingle-Leaflet Valve</h2>
    <p>A valve design with a single leaflet</p>
  </div>

  <div style="width: 50%">
    <p>that opens and closes to control blood flow.</p>

    <h2>Stenotic Valve</h2>
    <p>A valve that has become narrowed, restricting blood flow.</p>

    <h2>Stent Frame</h2>
    <p>
      A metal framework used to support valve prostheses during implantation.
    </p>

    <h2>Surgical Approach</h2>
    <p>The specific method or incision used during valve surgery.</p>

    <h2>Surgical Mesh</h2>
    <p>A mesh-like structure used in valve surgeries for tissue support.</p>

    <h2>Sutureless Valve Replacement</h2>
    <p>
      The process of replacing a damaged valve with a prosthetic or biological
      valve through surgery.
    </p>

    <h2>Sutureless Valve</h2>
    <p>
      A valve prosthesis that can be implanted without the need for sutures.
    </p>

    <h2 class="span1"><span>T</span>hrombosis Risk</h2>
    <p>The likelihood of a blood clot forming after valve surgery.</p>

    <h2>Tilting Disc Valve</h2>
    <p>A mechanical valve design with a disc that tilts to allow blood flow.</p>

    <h2>Tissue Engineering</h2>
    <p>
      The process of developing biological tissue replacements for damaged heart
      valves.
