    <h2>Valve Closure</h2>
    <p>
      The act of the valve leaflets sealing shut to prevent backflow of blood.

    <h2>Valve Complications</h2>
    <p>
      Potential issues, such as infections or blood clots, that can occur after
      valve surgery.

    <p>
      The process of compressing a valve for delivery during transcatheter valve
      replacement.
    </p>
    <h2>Valve Delivery System</h2>
    <p>
      The mechanism used to guide and place a valve during transcatheter
      procedures.

    <h2>Valve Dysfunction</h2>
    <p>A condition in which a heart valve fails to function properly.</p>

    <h2>Valve Fracture</h2>
    <p>
      A break or crack in a valve prosthesis, which may compromise its function.
