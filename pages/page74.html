    <h2 ><span>S</span>eroma Prevention</h2>
    <p>

    <h2 >Sterile Field</h2>
    <p>
      A specially prepared area free from microorganisms, maintained during

    <h2 ><span>T</span>horacoscopic Surgery</h2>
    <p>
      Minimally invasive surgery performed on the chest cavity using a
      thoracoscope.
    </p>

    <h2 >Tissue Approximation</h2>
    <p>
      The bringing together of tissues during surgery to promote healing,
      typically using sutures or adhesives.
    </p>

    <h2 >Tissue Integrity</h2>
    <p>
      The health and functional state of tissue, crucial for proper healing
      post-surgery.
    </p>

    <h2 >Tissue Reinforcement</h2>
    <p>
      Strengthening tissues, often using surgical meshes or grafts to support
      weak areas.
    </p>

    <h2 >Trocar</h2>
    <p>
      A surgical instrument used to create an opening in the body, commonly used
      in laparoscopic surgeries.

        <h2 >Wound Closure</h2>
        <p>
          The process <br> of sealing a wound <br> using sutures, <br> staples, or <br> adhesives <br> to
          promote healing.

    <h2 ><span>W</span>ound Healing</h2>
    <p>
      The physiological process by which the body repairs tissue damage after
      surgery or injury.
    </p>

    <h2 >Wound Infection</h2>
    <p>
      The invasion of microorganisms into a wound, leading to inflammation, pus,
      and delayed healing.
    </p>

    <h2 >Wound Retraction</h2>
    <p>
      The pulling back of wound edges, which can occur post-surgery and
      complicate healing.
    </p>

    <h2 >Wound Strength</h2>
    <p>
      The tensile strength of a wound as it 
heals, typically increasing as the 
tissue regenerates.
    </p>

    <h2 ><span>Z</span>-Stitch</h2>
    <p>
      A suture technique that creates a zigzag pattern to provide extra strength
      and reduce tension in wound closure.
