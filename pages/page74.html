    <p>cavity and covering abdominal organs.</p>
    <h2>Postoperative Adhesion</h2>
    <p>
      Scar tissue that forms after surgery, causing internal tissues or organs
      to stick together.
    </p>

    <h2 class="span1 capital">Radioopaque</h2>
    <p>
      A substance or material that does not allow X-rays to pass through, making
      it visible on radiographic images.
    </p>

    <h2>Rectus Sheath</h2>
    <p>
      A fibrous layer that encloses the rectus abdominis muscles in the
      abdominal wall.
    </p>

    <h2 class="span1 capital">Seroma Prevention</h2>
    <p>
      Methods used to prevent the accumulation of fluid (seroma) at a surgical
      site.
    </p>

    <h2>Sterile Field</h2>
    <p>
      A specially prepared area free from microorganisms, maintained during
      surgery to prevent infection.
    </p>

    <h2 class="span1 capital">Thoracoscopic Surgery</h2>
    <p>
      Minimally invasive surgery performed on the chest cavity using a
      thoracoscope.
    </p>

    <h2>Tissue Approximation</h2>
    <p>
      The bringing together of tissues during surgery to promote healing,
      typically using sutures or adhesives.
    </p>

    <h2>Tissue Integrity</h2>
    <p>
      The health and functional state of tissue, crucial for proper healing
      post-surgery.
    </p>

    <h2>Tissue Reinforcement</h2>
    <p>
      Strengthening tissues, often using surgical meshes or grafts to support
      weak areas.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- Right Column -->
  <div style="width: 50%">
    <h2>Trocar</h2>
    <p>
      A surgical instrument used to create an opening in the body, commonly used
      in laparoscopic surgeries.
    </p>

    <h2>Trocar Site Closure</h2>
    <p>
      The suturing or sealing of the incision made by a trocar during minimally
      invasive surgery.
    </p>
    <h2 class="span1 capital">Wound Closure</h2>

    <div style="display: flex">
      <div>
        <p>
          The process of sealing a wound using sutures, staples, or adhesives to
          promote healing.
        </p>
        <h2>Wound Healing</h2>
      </div>

          margin-top: -2vh;
        "
      />
    </div>

    <p>
      The physiological process by which the body repairs tissue damage after
      surgery or injury.
    </p>

    <h2>Wound Infection</h2>
    <p>
      The invasion of microorganisms into a wound, leading to inflammation, pus,
      and delayed healing.
    </p>

    <h2>Wound Retraction</h2>
    <p>
      The pulling back of wound edges, which can occur post-surgery and
      complicate healing.
    </p>

    <h2>Wound Strength</h2>
    <p>
      The tensile strength of a wound as it heals, typically increasing as the
      tissue regenerates.
    </p>

    <h2 class="span1 capital">Z-Stitch</h2>
    <p>
      A suture technique that creates a zigzag pattern to provide extra strength
      and reduce tension in wound closure.
