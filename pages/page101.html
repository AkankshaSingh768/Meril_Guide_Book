    <h2>Microarray</h2>
    <p>
      A tool used to detect the expression of thousands of genes simultaneously.
    </p>

    <h2>Molecular Diagnostics</h2>
    <p>
      Techniques that analyze biological markers at the molecular level,
      particularly DNA and RNA, to diagnose disease.
    </p>

    <h2>Monoclonal Antibody</h2>
    <p>
      Antibodies produced by identical immune cells, specific to a single
      antigen epitope.
    </p>

    <h2>Multiplexing</h2>
    <p>
      A technique that allows multiple targets to be analyzed in a single test
      or reaction.
    </p>

    <h2 class="span1 capital">Negative Predictive Value (NPV)</h2>
    <p>
      The likelihood that a negative test result accurately reflects the absence
      of the disease.
    </p>

    <h2>Nephelometry</h2>
    <p>
      A technique that measures scattered light to determine the concentration
      of particles in a solution.
    </p>

    <h2>Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)</h2>
    <p>
      Advanced sequencing technology allowing the rapid sequencing of entire
      genomes or targeted regions.
    </p>

    <h2>Northern Blot</h2>
    <p>A technique used to detect RNA molecules in a sample.</p>

    <h2 class="span1 capital">PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction)</h2>
    <p>A technique used to amplify small segments of DNA for analysis.</p>
    <h2>Phenotyping</h2>
    <p>
      The study of observable physical and biochemical traits, often resulting
      from

    <h2>Point-of-Care Testing (POCT)</h2>
    <p>
      Diagnostic testing performed at or near the site of patient care, often
      providing rapid results.
    </p>

    <h2>Polyclonal Antibodies</h2>
    <p>
      Antibodies produced by different immune cells, recognizing multiple
      epitopes on a single antigen.
    </p>

    <div style="display: flex">

        <h2>Positive Predictive Value (PPV)</h2>
        <p>
          The likelihood that a positive test result accurately reflects the
          presence of the disease.
        </p>
        <h2>Primer</h2>
        <p>
          Short DNA sequences used to initiate the replication process during
          PCR.

    </div>
    <p>
      A labeled DNA or RNA sequence used to detect the presence of a
      complementary sequence in a sample.
    </p>
    <h2>Proficiency Testing</h2>
    <p>
      A quality assurance process where laboratories evaluate their performance
      by testing samples with known outcomes.
    </p>

    <h2 class="span1 capital">QPCR (Quantitative PCR)</h2>
    <p>
      A PCR method that quantifies the amount of DNA by measuring fluorescence
      in real time.
    </p>

    <h2>Quality Assurance (QA)</h2>
    <p>
      A system for ensuring the maintenance of quality standards in diagnostic
      laboratories.
