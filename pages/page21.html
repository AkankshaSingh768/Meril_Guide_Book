    <h2 class="capital">Mechanical Valve</h2>
    <p>
      A man-made heart valve made from durable materials, designed for long-term
      use.
    </p>

    <h2>Mitral Regurgitation</h2>
    <p>
      A condition where the mitral valve leaks, allowing blood to flow backward
      into the left atrium.
    </p>

    <h2>Mitral Valve</h2>
    <p>
      The valve between the left atrium and left ventricle that ensures
      unidirectional blood flow.
    </p>

    <h2>Mitral Valve Prolapse</h2>
    <p>
      A condition where the mitral valve leaflets bulge into the left atrium
      during contraction.
    </p>

    <h2 class="span1 capital">Pacemaker Lead</h2>
    <p>
      A wire that connects a pacemaker to the heart, delivering electrical
      impulses to regulate heartbeat.
    </p>

    <h2>Paravalvular Leak</h2>
    <p>Leakage of blood around the edges of a valve prosthesis.</p>

    <h2>Paravalvular Regurgitation</h2>
    <p>Leakage around a valve prosthesis causing backward blood flow.</p>

    <h2>Percutaneous Valve Replacement</h2>
    <p>
      Valve replacement procedure performed through a catheter-based approach.
    </p>
    <h2>Post-Dilatation</h2>
    <p>Expanding a valve or vessel with a balloon after initial placement.</p>
    <h2>Postoperative Monitoring</h2>
    <p>
      Observing a patient's condition after surgery to ensure proper recovery.
    </p>

    <h2>Prosthetic Valve</h2>
    <p>An artificial valve used to replace a damaged heart valve.</p>

    <h2>Pulmonary Hypertension</h2>
    <p>Increased blood pressure in the lungs’ arteries.</p>

    <h2>Pulmonary Valve</h2>
    <p>
      The valve between the right ventricle and pulmonary artery that controls
      blood flow to the lungs.
    </p>

    <h2 class="span1 capital">Right Ventricle</h2>
    <p>
      The lower right chamber of the heart that pumps deoxygenated blood to the
      lungs.
    </p>

    <h2>Right Ventricular Outflow Tract <br>(RVOT)</h2>
    <p>
      The passageway through which blood flows from the right ventricle into the
      pulmonary artery.
    </p>

    <h2 class="span1 capital">Self-Expanding Valve</h2>
    <p>
      A valve that expands on its own once deployed from its delivery system.
    </p>

    <h2>Stenotic Valve</h2>
    <p>
      A valve that is narrowed and does not allow normal blood flow through it.
    </p>

    <h2>Structural Heart Disease</h2>
    <p>
      A group of heart conditions involving abnormalities in the heart’s
      structure.
