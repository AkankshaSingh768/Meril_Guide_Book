    <h2>Transabdominal Preperitoneal Repair (TAPP)</h2>
    <p>
      Hernia repair performed through the abdomen with access to the
      preperitoneal space.
    </p>

    <h2>Transverse Abdominis Release (TAR)</h2>
    <p>
      A surgical technique to repair complex ventral hernias by releasing the
      transverse abdominis muscle and reinforcing with mesh.

    <h2>Wound Infection</h2>
    <p>Infection occurring at the site of a wound or surgical incision.</p>

    <h2>Wound Reinforcement</h2>
    <p>Use of materials to strengthen the wound site and promote healing.</p>

    <h2>Wound Retraction</h2>
    <p>
      The process by which the edges of a wound pull apart or move away from
      each other.
    </p>
