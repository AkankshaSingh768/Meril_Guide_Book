      segments of the intestine.
    </p>

    <h2>Aneurysm Repair</h2>
    <p>
      Surgical procedure to correct an abnormal bulging or dilation of an
      artery.
    </p>

    <h2>Anticoagulation</h2>
    <p>The use of medication to prevent blood clot formation.</p>

    <h2>Aortic Arch</h2>
    <p>

      neck.
    </p>

    <h2>Aortic Clamp</h2>
    <p>
      A device used to temporarily occlude the aorta during surgery, allowing
      for controlled blood flow.
    </p>

    <h2>Aortic Dissection</h2>
    <p>
      A serious condition where there is a tear in the wall of the aorta,
      causing blood to flow between the layers.
    </p>

    <h2>Aortic Root</h2>
    <p>
      The section of the aorta closest to the heart, including the aortic valve
      and its surrounding structures.
    </p>

    <h2>Aortic Valve</h2>
    <p>
      Valve between the left ventricle and the aorta, regulating blood flow from

      the head and upper body.
    </p>

    <h2>Atrial Fibrillation (AF)</h2>

      and right atria.
    </p>

    <h2 class="span1 capital">Calcification</h2>
    <p>
      The buildup of calcium deposits on heart valves, leading to stiffening and
      reduced function.
    </p>

    <h2>Cardiac Output</h2>
    <p>
      The amount of blood the heart pumps per minute, an indicator of heart
      efficiency.
    </p>

    <h2>Cardiomyopathy</h2>
    <p>
      Disease of the heart muscle that affects its size, shape, and function.
    </p>

    <h2>Cardioplegia</h2>
    <p>
      Induced cessation of heart muscle activity during surgery to protect it
      from damage.
    </p>

    <h2>Cardioplegic Solution</h2>
    <p>
      A solution used to induce cardiac arrest and protect the heart muscle
      during surgery.
    </p>

    <h2>Cardiopulmonary Bypass (CPB)</h2>
    <p>
