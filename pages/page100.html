    <h2>Fluorescent Antibody</h2>
    <p>
      An antibody labeled with a fluorescent dye, used in immunoassays to detect
      specific antigens.
    </p>

    <h2 class="span1 capital">Genotyping</h2>
    <p>
      The process of determining the genetic makeup (genotype) of an individual
      by examining their DNA sequence.
    </p>

    <h2 class="span1 capital">Histopathology</h2>
    <p>
      The study of tissue changes caused by disease, often used in cancer
      diagnostics.
    </p>

    <h2>Hybridization</h2>
    <p>The process of pairing complementary strands of DNA or RNA.</p>

    <h2 class="span1 capital">Immunoassay</h2>
    <p>
      A biochemical test that uses the binding of antibodies to detect and
      measure substances.
    </p>

    <h2>Immunohematology</h2>
    <p>
      The study of blood group antigens and antibodies, essential in blood
      transfusion services.
    </p>

    <h2>Immunohistochemistry (IHC)</h2>
    <p>
      A technique for detecting specific proteins in tissue sections using an
      bodies linked to a marker.
    </p>

    <h2>In Vitro</h2>
    <p>
      Experiments conducted outside a living organism, usually in a lab dish or
      test tube.
    </p>
    <h2>In Vivo</h2>
    <p>Experiments conducted in a living organism.</p>
    <h2>Incubation Time</h2>
  </div>

  <!-- Right Column -->
  <div style="width: 50%">
    <p>
      The period during which a sample is maintained under controlled conditions
      to allow a reaction or growth to occur.
    </p>

    <h2>Interference</h2>
    <p>
      The effect of external substances or conditions that can alter the
      accuracy of a diagnostic test.
    </p>

    <h2>ISO 15189</h2>
    <p>
      An international standard that specifies the quality and competence
      requirements for medical laboratories.
    </p>

    <h2 class="span1 capital">Kinetic Assay</h2>
    <p>
      An assay that measures the rate of reaction over time, providing dynamic
      information about the reaction.
    </p>

    <h2 class="span1 capital">Limit of Detection (LOD)</h2>
    <p>
      The smallest concentration of a substance that can be reliably detected
      but not necessarily quantified by an assay.
    </p>

    <h2>Limit of Quantitation (LOQ)</h2>
    <p>
      The smallest concentration of a substance that can be quantitatively
      measured with acceptable accuracy and precision.
    </p>

    <h2>Linearity</h2>
    <p>
      The ability of a test to provide results that are directly proportional to
      the concentration of the substance being measured.
    </p>
