       used in 
various assays for detection and 
analysis.
    </p>

    <h2 >Fluorescent Antibody</h2>
    <p>
      An antibody labeled with a 
fluorescent dye, used in 
immunoassays to detect specific 
antigens.
    </p>

    <h2 class="span1" ><span>G</span>enotyping</h2>
    <p>
      The process of determining the genetic makeup (genotype) of an individual
      by examining their DNA sequence.
    </p>

    <h2 class="span1" ><span>H</span>istopathology</h2>
    <p>
      The study of tissue changes caused by disease, often used in cancer
      diagnostics.
    </p>

    <h2 >Hybridization</h2>
    <p>The process of pairing complementary strands of DNA or RNA.</p>

    <h2 class="span1" ><span>I</span>mmunoassay</h2>
    <p>
 A biochemical test that uses the 
binding of antibodies to detect and 
measure substances.</p>

  <h2>Immunohematology</h2>
  <p>The study of blood group antigens 
and antibodies, essential in blood 
transfusion services.</p>
 


    <h2 >
      Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
    </h2>
    <p>
      A technique for detecting specific 
proteins in tissue sections using 
an bodies linked to a marker.
    </p>

    <h2 >In Vitro</h2>
    <p>
      Experiments conducted outside a 
living organism, usually in a lab dish 
or test tube.
    </p>
    <h2 >In Vivo</h2>
    <p>Experiments conducted in a living organism.</p>

    <h2 >Incubation Time</h2>
    <p>
      The period during which a sample is 
maintained under controlled 
conditions to allow a reaction or 
growth to occur.
    </p>

    <h2 >Interference</h2>
    <p>
      The effect of external substances or 
conditions that can alter the 
accuracy of a diagnostic test.
    </p>

    <h2 >ISO 15189</h2>
    <p>
      An international standard that specifies the quality and competence
      requirements for medical laboratories.
    </p>

    <h2 class="span1" ><span>K</span>inetic Assay</h2>
    <p>
     
 An assay that measures the rate of 
reaction over time, providing 
dynamic information about the 
reaction.
    </p>

    <h2 class="span1" ><span>L</span>imit of Detection (LOD)</h2>
    <p>
 The smallest concentration of a 
substance that can be reliably 
detected but not necessarily 
quantified by an assay.
    </p>

    <h2 >
      Limit of Quantitation (LOQ)
    </h2>
    <p>
      The smallest concentration of a substance that can be quantitatively
      measured with acceptable accuracy and precision.
    </p>

    <h2 >Linearity</h2>
    <p>
      The ability of a test to provide results that are directly proportional to
      the concentration of the substance being measured.
    </p>

    <div style="display: flex;">
      <div>
        <h2 class="span1" ><span>M</span>atrix</h2>
    <p>The environment in which a sample is found, such as blood</p>
    <p>or urine, affecting the interpretaon of test results.</p>
