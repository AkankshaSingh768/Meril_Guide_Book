    <h2>Quality Control (QC)</h2>
    <p>
      Procedures implemented to ensure the accuracy and reliability of
      diagnostic tests.
    </p>
    <h2 class="span1"><span>R</span>andomized Control Trial (RCT)</h2>
    <p>
      A PCR technique that converts RNA into DNA before amplification, often
      used for detecting RNA viruses.
    </p>

    <h2>Reagent</h2>
    <p>
      A substance used in a chemical reaction to detect, measure, examine, or
      produce other substances.
    </p>

    <h2>Reference Range</h2>
    <p>
      The range of values considered normal for a specific test in a defined
      population.
    </p>

    <h2>Regulatory Affairs</h2>
    <p>
      The management of processes related to ensuring that diagnostic tests
      comply with laws and regulations.
    </p>

    <h2>RNA Extraction</h2>
    <p>The process of isolating RNA from a biological sample.</p>

    <h2>RT-PCR (Reverse Transcriptase PCR)</h2>
    <p>
      A PCR technique that converts RNA into DNA for gene amplification, widely
      used for detecting RNA viruses.
    </p>

    <h2 class="span1"><span>S</span>ample Preparation</h2>
    <p>
      The process of preparing a biological specimen for analysis, including
      extraction, dilution, or concentration.
    </p>

    <h2>Sensitivity</h2>
    <p>
      The ability of a test to correctly identify individuals with a disease
      (true positive rate).
    </p>

    <h2>Serology</h2>
    <p>
      The study of blood serum, particularly regarding immune responses and the
      presence of antibodies.

        <p>A method used to detect specific DNA sequences in a sample.</p>
        <h2>Specificity</h2>
        <p>
          The ability of a test to correctly identify individuals without a
          disease (true negative rate).

    <h2>Specimen Collection</h2>
    <p>
      The process of obtaining biological samples, such as blood or tissue, for
      diagnostic testing.
    </p>

    <h2>Spectrophotometry</h2>
    <p>
      A technique that measures how much a chemical substance absorbs light by
      measuring the intensity of light as a function of wavelength.
    </p>

    <h2>Stability</h2>
    <p>
      The ability of a sample or reagent to maintain its integrity under
      specified storage conditions.
    </p>

    <h2>Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)</h2>
    <p>
      A set of step-by-step instructions to ensure consistent and accurate
      laboratory practices.
    </p>

    <h2 class="span1"><span>T</span>hroughput</h2>
    <p>
      The number of tests or samples that can be processed by a diagnostic
      system in a given period.
    </p>

    <h2>Titer</h2>
    <p>
      The concentration of antibodies or antigens in a sample, often measured by
      serial dilution.
    </p>

    <h2>Transport Medium</h2>
    <p>
      A solution used to preserve a specimen during transport to the laboratory.
