    <p>
      A sample used to ensure the validity of an assay, typically showing
      expected outcomes.
    </p>

    <h2 >Cross-reactivity</h2>
    <p>
      The ability of an antibody or assay to react with similar but different
      antigens, leading to potential false results.
    </p>

    <h2 >Cutoff Threshold</h2>
    <p>
       The value at which a test result is 
interpreted as positive or negative.
    </p>

    <h2 >Cut-off Value</h2>
    <p>
      The threshold at which a test result 
is considered positive or negative.
    </p>

    <h2 >Cytology</h2>
    <p>
      The examination of individual cells 
to detect disease, such as cancer.
    </p>

    <h2 class="span1" ><span>D</span>iagnostic Sensitivity</h2>
    <p>
      The proportion of true positive cases correctly identified by a diagnostic
      test.
    </p>

    <h2 >Diagnostic Specificity</h2>
    <p>
      The proportion of true negative cases correctly identified by a diagnostic
      test.
    </p>

    <h2 >Diluent</h2>
    <p>
      A substance used to dilute a sample or reagent to the required
      concentration.
    </p>

    <h2 >DNA Extraction</h2>
    <p>The process of isolating DNA from a biological sample.</p>

    <h2 >Double-Blind Study</h2>
    <p>
      A study in which neither the participants nor the investigators know which
      intervention participants are receiving, to avoid bias.
    </p>

    <h2 >
      Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR)
    </h2>
    <p>
      A precise method of PCR that 
partitions the sample into 
thousands of droplets for absolute 
quantification of DNA/RNA.

    <h2 ><span>E</span>lectrophoresis</h2>
    <p>
      A method that separates molecules, 
such as DNA or proteins, based on 
their size and electrical charge.
    </p>

    <h2 >
      ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay)
    </h2>
    <p>
       A test that detects and measures 
an bodies, antigens, proteins, or 
hormones in a sample.
    </p>

    <h2 >End Point Assay</h2>
    <p>
      A type of assay where measurements are taken at a fixed time point after
      the reaction has reached completion.
    </p>

    <h2 >Enzyme Substrate</h2>
    <p>
     A molecule on which an enzyme 
acts, often used in assays to 
produce a measurable product.
    </p>

    <h2 >Ex Vivo</h2>
    <p>
       Studies or experiments conducted 
on tissue taken from a living 
organism.
    </p>

    <h2 class="span1" ><span>F</span>alse Negative</h2>
    <p>
 A test result indicating that a 
condition or attribute is absent 
when it is present.
    </p>

    <h2 >False Positive</h2>
    <p>
      A test result indicating that a condition or attribute is present when it
      is not.
    </p>

    <h2 >Flow Cytometry</h2>
    <p>
     A technology used to analyze the 
physical and chemical 
characteristics of cells or paryicles 
in a fluid.
