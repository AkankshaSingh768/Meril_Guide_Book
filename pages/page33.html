    <h2 >Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG)</h2>
    <p>
      Surgery to bypass blocked coronary arteries using grafts to restore blood
      flow to the heart.
    </p>

    <h2>Cross-Clamp</h2>
    <p>
      A clamp placed across the aorta to stop blood flow during cardiac surgery.

    <h2 class="span1"><span>D</span>efibrillator</h2>
    <p>
      A device used to deliver an electric shock to restore a normal heart
      rhythm in cases of severe arrhythmia.
    </p>

    <h2>Dilated Cardiomyopathy</h2>
    <p>
      A condition where the heart becomes enlarged and weakened, reducing its
      ability to pump blood.
    </p>

    <h2 class="span1"><span>E</span>chocardiography</h2>
    <p>
      Ultrasound imaging of the heart to evaluate its structure and function.
    </p>

    <h2>Ejection Fraction</h2>
    <p>
      The percentage of blood pumped out of the heart's left ventricle with each
      beat.
    </p>

    <h2>Endarterectomy</h2>
    <p>
      Surgical procedure to remove 
plaque from inside an artery to 
restore blood flow.
    </p>

    <h2>Endocarditis</h2>
    <p>
      Inflammation of the inner lining of 
the heart, typically due to infection.
    </p>


    <h2>Endovascular Surgery</h2>
    <p>
      Minimally invasive surgery 
performed inside blood vessels, 
often using catheters and guide 
wires.
    </p>
 


    <h2>Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO)</h2>
    <p>
      A life-support technique that 
oxygenates blood outside the body 
when the heart and lungs cannot do 
so.

    <h2 ><span>F</span>luoroscopy</h2>
    <p>
      Real-time X-ray imaging used to visualize movement within the body, such
      as during catheter placement.
    </p>

    <h2 class="span1"><span>G</span>raft</h2>
    <p>
      A surgical implant used to bypass blocked arteries, commonly made of vein
      or synthetic material.
    </p>

    <h2 class="span1"><span>H</span>eart-Lung Machine</h2>
    <p>
      The device used during cardiopulmonary bypass to oxygenate blood and
      maintain circulation.
    </p>

    <h2>Hemodynamics</h2>
    <p>
      The study of blood flow and its properties, including blood pressure and
      cardiac output.
    </p>

    <h2>Hemostasis</h2>
    <p>
      The process of stopping bleeding and maintaining blood flow during and
      after surgery.
    </p>

    <h2>Hybrid Operating Room</h2>
    <p>
      A surgical suite equipped with 
imaging technology for performing 
both traditional and minimally 
invasive procedures.
    </p>
    <h2>Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy</h2>
    <p>
      A condition where the heart muscle becomes abnormally thick, making it
      harder to pump blood.
    </p>

    <div style="display: flex">
